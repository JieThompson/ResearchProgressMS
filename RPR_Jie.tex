\begin{abstract}

Microwave spectroscopy for detecting various resonance  of electrons is our main focus and we have been using electrical, thermal and absorption method for different purposes.

Electron spin resonance (ESR) and cyclotron resonance (CR) are two of the most significant feature of electrons under magnetic field where electrical detection requires contacts on the sample which usually causes damages.
In order to detect the ESR of a single nano-object, high sensitive tool is required.
So far, the best commercial ESR detector can detect around 1000 spins.
We develop an ultra-sensitive calorimeter which is aimed at resolving the ESR of one nano-object.
As a pretest, we show that CR can be measured via heat generated by resonant absorption of photons.
An increase in the lattice temperature can be detected when the energy of the incident microwave photons matches the energy difference between adjacent Landau levels.
They will be absorbed converting to phonons via non-radiative relaxation.
A nano-calorimetry is constructed which can operate at \SI{300}{\milli\kelvin} and precision of our thermometer is improved to tens of micro-Kelvins, thereby increasing the sensitivity to several nano-watts.

Edge state transport is also an interest of ours due to its pure one dimensionality and dissipationless feature.
Microwave absorption spectroscopy of quantum droplet on two dimensional electron/hole gas is a powerful tool investigating the number and velocities of the charge modes.
We have sample patterned with multiple circular dots on the order of several microns.
It is directly placed onto the meander line superconducting waveguide positioned inside a resonance container.
The whole setup is attached to the bottom of a top loaded \ce{^{3}He} cryostat with base temperature down to \SI{300}{\milli\kelvin}.
This absence of quantum contact has the advantage over standard transport measurement with its high sensitivity and could be generalized to a common method probing edge states hosted in other new materials.

\chapter{Introduction}\label{Intro}







\chapter{Transport behavior of electrons under the illumination of microwave}\label{Transport}

\section{Shubnikov de Haas oscillations}\label{SdHO}
Shubnikov de Haas oscillations represents how longitudinal resistance of a Hallbar sample behaves in low magnetic field range.
As soon as magnetic field is applied on a 2DEG system, the constant density of state immediately becomes isolated Dirac functions ideally with a spacing of $\hbar\omega_{c}$, where $\omega_{c}: =\frac{eB}{m^{*}}$ is the cyclotron frequency.
But the reality is they get broadened since the electrons can't avoid being scattered by other electrons, holes, phonons and impurities.
These extended functions are the so-called Landau Levels with the same peak-peak spacing and a full width at half maximum being $\Gamma=\hbar/\tau q$.
Here $q$ is the quantum life time meaning the time span between two scattering events.
In order to resolve the peak, one has to have sufficient magnetic field to meet the requirement $\hbar\omega_{c}>\Gamma$ or $\omega_{c}\tau q>1$.
That means electron has to survive long enough to fulfill at least one cyclotron orbit without scattering.
The total number of states in each Landau Level per unit area is marked by $n_{B}=\frac{eB}{h}$ giving a filling factor of $\mu =\frac{n_{2D}}{n_{B}}=\frac{h}{eB}n_{2D}$.
Therefore, when the Fermi energy lies between two separate Landau Levels, longitudinal conductance reaches a local minimum and it gets to a local maximum when $E_{F}$ lies on the peak.
As a function of magnetic field, the longitudinal resistance $R_{xx}$ represents oscillating behaviors which is known as Shubnikov de Haas oscillations (see \figureref{sdho}).

\section{MIRO and ZRS}\label{MIRO&ZRS}

When microwave is applied, the figure changes quite dramatically.
Additional maximums appear with different intensity at different harmonic peaks which is known as Microwave Induced Resistance Oscillations (MIRO).
MIRO is fascinating nonequilibrium transport phenomenon universal in both n-type and p-type ultrahigh mobility 2D systems. 

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[totalheight=8cm]{figures/miro.JPG}
  \caption{Microwave Induced Resistance Oscillations}
  \label{miro}
\end{figure}
 
Theoretical explanation of MIRO are stated as displacement mechanism and inelastic mechanism [Phys Rev. B 89, 125401 (2014)], both modify the scattering of electrons due to microwave assistance and predict the photoresistance oscillates as 
\begin{align}
\delta R_{\omega}/R_{0} =-2\pi\eta P\lambda^{2}\epsilon \sin(2\pi\epsilon)
\end{align} 
where $\eta$ is the dimensionless scattering rate, $P$ is the dimensionless microwave power, $\lambda$ is the Dingle factor which is related to the quantum lifetime as well as cyclotron frequency and $\epsilon :=\omega/\omega_{c}$. 

Zero resistance state is revealed at the local minimum of MIRO and can be explained as the interaction between microwave and electrons.





\chapter{Thermal detection on behavior of electrons under the illumination of microwave}\label{Thermal}





\section{Theoretical support and preparation in \SI{4}{K}}\label{Theoretical}

As stated in the first chapter, the density of state of 2DEG forms Landau Levels when magnetic field is applied.
Sweeping either microwave frequency or magnetic field will result in the case where energy of the incident photos equal to the energy gap of the Landau levels, therefore causing resonance phenomenon.
However, in \ce{AlGaAs/GaAs} material, electrons relaxation process can be non-radiative by passing the extra energy to phonons and raising lattice temperature.
This temperature change can be measured by a nano-caloriometer we constructed using special Cernox thermometer which has a huge resistance difference for a tiny temperature change at low temperature.  

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[scale=0.5]{figures/llformation.JPG}

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[scale=0.25]{figures/nonradiative.JPG}
  \caption{Non-radiative relaxation}
  \label{nonradiative}
\end{figure}

This resonance measuring method has been tested in our group with liquid helium for detecting geometric resonance which the coupling between cyclotron resonance and plasma resonance. 
On a bare 2DEG chip, cyclotron resonance dips can be resolved clearly.

The coupled frequency can be calculated by the following equation. 

%\begin{figure}
%  \centering
%  \includegraphics[totalheight=8cm]{figures/.JPG}
%  \caption{Non-radiative relaxation}
%  \label{nonradiative}
%\end{figure}

However, on a dot (on the order of \si{\micro\meter}) patterned sample, one can see there are two obvious resonance dips on each side which relate to the plus and minus resonance frequencies shown below.  

%\begin{figure}
%  \centering

%\end{figure}

\begin{align}
\omega_{\pm}=\frac{\omega_{c}}{2} \pm \sqrt{ \omega_{0}^{2}+ \left(\frac{ \omega_{c} }{2}\right)^{2}}
\end{align}

Here $\displaystyle \omega_{0}^{2}=\frac{N_{s}e^{2}}{2m^{\ast}\epsilon_{\mathrm{eff}}r}$, in our sample, the electron density $N_{s}=\SI{2.5e11}{\centi\meter^{-2}}$, effective mass $m^{*}=0.067m_{e}$, $\epsilon_{\mathrm{eff}}=\frac{1+12}{2}=6.5$ and $r$ is the radius of the dots.

Boundary plasmon has been eliminated by choosing irregularly shaped samples and frequency is limited by the size of our waveguide though it could be extended using frequency multiplier and replacing with coaxial cable. 

 
\section{Setup Construction}\label{Construction}

In order to improve the sensitivity, we constructed another setup which works in \SI{300}{\milli\kelvin} due to the fact that the lower the temperature gets, the shaper resistance line the Cernox thermometer's resistance will act (\figureref{r(t)}).

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[scale=0.5]{figures/thermometercx.JPG}
  \caption{Cernox thermometer}
  \label{thermometer}
\end{figure}
 
\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[scale=0.5]{figures/R(T).JPG}
  \caption{Temperature dependence of the thermometers}
  \label{r(t)}
\end{figure} 
 
However, going from \SI{4}{\kelvin} to \SI{300}{\milli\kelvin} is a big leap and there are problems that we have to overcome.
The most significant one is sealing in \ce{^{3}He} liquid environment.
Since the heat generated by the non-radiative relaxation is very small, the sample need to be in vacuum to avoid being carried away by massive \ce{^{3}He} liquid and a high heat conductive media to pass the temperature change to the thermometer.
Meanwhile, to keep the temperature around \SI{300}{\milli\kelvin}, we need something with low heat conductivity to connect the inside setup to outside.
In this case, we use thin sapphire crystal (cut by a diamond saw) as the bridge between sample and thermometer, thin magnin wire for keeping vacuum temperature low.
Sealing in \ce{^{3}He} liquid environment is hard due to the fact that it's molecules are so small that they'll just enter every tiny gap.
The way we used to seal is tapping the inner wall of the cap and outer wall of the base therefore compressing the flat surfaces of those two parts to seal.
But this is still not enough since the surfaces are polished mechanically only.
We dissolve soap in Glycerin and then scribble it on the surfaces to fill up any possible tiny gap.
Validation of the sealing can only be tested by whether the CR signal is resolved.

The whole vacuum can is immersed in \ce{^{3}He} liquid in a top-loaded \ce{^{3}He} refrigerator.
Microwave is sent through a self-made antenna which is connected to the coaxial cable in the probe (see \figureref{probe} and \figureref{thermal-schema}).

\end{figure}

\section{Cyclotron Resonance Pretest}\label{Cyclotron}


 
We used a differential circuit to filter the background noise and amplitude modulation technique to quench the asymmetry left in the differential geometry.
The voltage signal difference from the two arms can be calculated in this formula: 

\begin{align} 
\frac{|\tilde{E}|}{|\tilde{V}|}=\frac{j \omega_{0}(M+L)\delta R}{R^{2}+2R j \omega_{0}L + \omega_{0}^{2} (M^{2}-L^{2})} \approx \frac{\delta R}{2R}
\end{align} 
 
That indicates that the output signal $V_{\mathrm{out}}$ is linearly proportional to the difference between the resistance of those two Cernox thermometers $\delta R$ which reflects the amount of heat generated by the sample with the illumination of microwave.
The differential signal was fed into the first lock-in amplifier the output of which then was fed into the second Lock-in. 
The amplitude of the input microwave is modulated internally by the microwave generator according to the frequency of the second Lock-in amp which should be much smaller than the rapid oscillating factor of the first Lock-in amp. 
Therefore, after integrating twice, the final output should be a clean response of 2DEG CR signal.     
 
\figureref{r(b)} is the response of the thermometer resistance without microwave illumination when magnetic field is swept. 
This background indicates that the direction of the magnetic field has asymmetric influence on the two branches. 
\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[scale=0.5]{figures/R(B)UP.JPG}
  \caption{Background sweeping}
  \label{r(b)}
\end{figure}

When microwave is applied, obvious resonance peaks appear on each side (see \figureref{0dbm_40ghz}) and the larger the microwave power gets, the higher the resonance peaks shoot. In \figureref{thermopowerdep}, one can see that the signal can still be resolved even with power as low as -20dbm (\SI{0.01}{\milli \watt}). 
Compared to the setup without these two measuring techniques, sensitivity is at least thirty times higher in terms of input microwave power.

\section{Spin Resonance on DPPH}\label{DPPH}

Electron spin resonance (ESR) or Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy is a technique for studying materials with unpaired electrons using the Zeeman splitting 
\begin{align}
E=m_{s} g \mu_{B} B_{0}
\end{align}
where g is the electron's Landé g-factor.For the free electron, $g=2.0023$, $\mu_{B}$ is the Bohr magneton.
Therefore, resonance peak happens at 
\begin{align}
\Delta E=g \mu_{B} B_{0}
\end{align}

Conventional method of measuring ESR (commercialized) is transmission spectroscopy which measures the transmission or reflection coefficient.   
There are other ways such as magnetic torque detection, optically detected ESR, STM-ESR and resistively detected ESR which measures the longitudinal resistance of 2DEG. Our thermal detection method is another one by measuring the temperature change induced by the non-radiative relaxation of the photon absorption.

DPPH is a common abbreviation for an organic chemical compound 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl which has two major applications. One is for monitoring chemical reactions involving radicals while the other is determining the position and intensity of ESR signals. 
In our case, we use dpph to test if ESR signal can be resolved by our setup. Raw data is shown in \figureref{dpph_esr} and a clear resonance dip showed up around \SI{1.42}{\tesla} with a line width of 150 Gauss at the microwave frequency of \SI{40}{\giga \hertz}.
Therefore, the g-factor is
\begin{align}
g=\frac{\hbar \omega}{\mu_{B}B}=1.9934
\end{align}
while the theoretical value is the free electron $g=2.0023$.
\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[scale=0.5]{figures/dpph_esr.JPG}
  \caption{ESR of DPPH}
  \label{dpph_esr}
\end{figure}
 
By subtracting the background and fitting with a Lorentzian (\figureref{dpph_fitting}): 

\begin{align}
L(B)=\frac{A}{[1+ (\frac{\mu g \tau}{h})(B-B_{r})]^{2}}
\end{align}  
we have a decoherence time $\tau = \SI{7.78}{\nano\second}$ which is a reasonable value in our case.

  \centering
  \includegraphics[scale=0.5]{figures/dpph_fitting.JPG}
  \caption{ESR Fitting of DPPH}
  \label{dpph_fitting}
\end{figure}
 
Here, we demonstrated that the nano-calorimeter we constructed has the ability to resolve both CR and ESR signals for those material which has a non-radiative relaxation process.
