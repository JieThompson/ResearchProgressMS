\begin{abstract}

Microwave spectroscopy for detecting various resonance  of electrons is our main focus and we have been using electrical, thermal and absorption method for different purposes.

Electron spin resonance (ESR) and cyclotron resonance (CR) are two of the most significant feature of electrons under magnetic field where electrical detection requires contacts on the sample which usually causes damages.
In order to detect the ESR of a single nano-object, high sensitive tool is required.
So far, the best commercial ESR detector can detect around 1000 spins.
We develop an ultra-sensitive calorimeter which is aimed at resolving the ESR of one nano-object.
As a pretest, we show that CR can be measured via heat generated by resonant absorption of photons.
An increase in the lattice temperature can be detected when the energy of the incident microwave photons matches the energy difference between adjacent Landau levels.
They will be absorbed converting to phonons via non-radiative relaxation.
A nano-calorimetry is constructed which can operate at \SI{300}{\milli\kelvin} and precision of our thermometer is improved to tens of micro-Kelvins, thereby increasing the sensitivity to several nano-watts.

Edge state transport is also an interest of ours due to its pure one dimensionality and dissipationless feature.
Microwave absorption spectroscopy of quantum droplet on two dimensional electron/hole gas is a powerful tool investigating the number and velocities of the charge modes.
We have sample patterned with multiple circular dots on the order of several microns.
It is directly placed onto the meander line superconducting waveguide positioned inside a resonance container.
The whole setup is attached to the bottom of a top loaded \ce{^{3}He} cryostat with base temperature down to \SI{300}{\milli\kelvin}.
This absence of quantum contact has the advantage over standard transport measurement with its high sensitivity and could be generalized to a common method probing edge states hosted in other new materials.

\chapter{Transport behavior of electrons under the illumination of microwave}\label{Transport}

\section{Shubnikov de Haas oscillations}\label{SdHO}
Shubnikov de Haas oscillations represents how longitudinal resistance of a Hallbar sample behaves in low magnetic field range.
As soon as magnetic field is applied on a 2DEG system, the constant density of state immediately becomes isolated Dirac functions ideally with a spacing of $\hbar\omega_{c}$, where $\omega_{c}: =\frac{eB}{m^{*}}$ is the cyclotron frequency.
But the reality is they get broadened since the electrons can't avoid being scattered by other electrons, holes, phonons and impurities.
These extended functions are the so-called Landau Levels with the same peak-peak spacing and a full width at half maximum being $\Gamma=\hbar/\tau q$.
Here $q$ is the quantum life time meaning the time span between two scattering events.
In order to resolve the peak, one has to have sufficient magnetic field to meet the requirement $\hbar\omega_{c}>\Gamma$ or $\omega_{c}\tau q>1$.
That means electron has to survive long enough to fulfill at least one cyclotron orbit without scattering.
The total number of states in each Landau Level per unit area is marked by $n_{B}=\frac{eB}{h}$ giving a filling factor of $\mu =\frac{n_{2D}}{n_{B}}=\frac{h}{eB}n_{2D}$.
Therefore, when the Fermi energy lies between two separate Landau Levels, longitudinal conductance reaches a local minimum and it gets to a local maximum when $E_{F}$ lies on the peak.
As a function of magnetic field, the longitudinal resistance $R_{xx}$ represents oscillating behaviors which is known as Shubnikov de Haas oscillations (see \figureref{sdho}).

\section{Microwave induced resistance oscillations}\label{MIRO}

When microwave is applied, the figure changes quite dramatically.
Additional maximums appear with different intensity at different harmonic peaks which is known as Microwave induced resistance oscillations (MIRO).
MIRO is fascinating nonequilibrium transport phenomenon universal in both n-type and p-type ultrahigh mobility 2D systems. 


 
Theoretical explanation of MIRO are stated as displacement mechanism and inelastic mechanism [Phys Rev. B 89, 125401 (2014)], both modify the scattering of electrons due to microwave assistance and predict the photoresistance oscillates as 
\begin{align}
\delta R_{\omega}/R_{0} =-2\pi\eta P\lambda^{2}\epsilon \sin(2\pi\epsilon)
\end{align} 
where $\eta$ is the dimensionless scattering rate, $P$ is the dimensionless microwave power, $\lambda$ is the Dingle factor which is related to the quantum lifetime as well as cyclotron frequency and $\epsilon :=\omega/\omega_{c}$. 



\chapter{Thermal detection on behavior of electrons under the illumination of microwave}\label{Thermal}





\section{Theoretical support and preparation in \SI{4}{K}}\label{Theoretical}

As stated in the first chapter, the density of state of 2DEG forms Landau Levels when magnetic field is applied.
Sweeping either microwave frequency or magnetic field will result in the case where energy of the incident photos equal to the energy gap of the Landau levels, therefore causing resonance phenomenon.
However, in \ce{AlGaAs/GaAs} material, electrons relaxation process can be non-radiative by passing the extra energy to phonons and raising lattice temperature.
This temperature change can be measured by a nano-caloriometer we constructed using special Cernox thermometer which has a huge resistance difference for a tiny temperature change at low temperature.

   \end{minipage}
\end{figure}



This resonance measuring method has been tested in our group with liquid helium for detecting geometric resonance which the coupling between cyclotron resonance and plasma resonance. 
On a bare 2DEG chip, cyclotron resonance dips can be resolved clearly.


However, on a dot (on the order of \si{\micro\meter}) patterned sample, one can see there are two obvious resonance dips on each side which relate to the plus and minus resonance frequencies shown below.

\omega_{\pm}=\frac{\omega_{c}}{2} \pm \sqrt{ \omega_{0}^{2}+ \left(\frac{ \omega_{c} }{2}\right)^{2}}
\end{align}

[from Dimensional resonance of the two-dimensional electron gas in selectively doped GaAs/A1GaAs heterostructures Phys. Rev. B 28, 4875(R) 1983]

Here $\displaystyle \omega_{0}^{2}=\frac{N_{s}e^{2}}{2m^{\ast}\epsilon_{\mathrm{eff}}r}$, in our sample, the electron density $N_{s}=\SI{2.5e11}{\centi\meter^{-2}}$, effective mass $m^{*}=0.067m_{e}$, $\epsilon_{\mathrm{eff}}=\frac{1+12}{2}=6.5$ and $r$ is the radius of the dots.

Boundary plasmon has been eliminated by choosing irregularly shaped samples and frequency is limited by the size of our waveguide though it could be extended using frequency multiplier and replacing with coaxial cable. 

 
\section{Setup construction}\label{Construction}

In order to improve the sensitivity, we constructed another setup which works in \SI{300}{\milli\kelvin} due to the fact that the lower the temperature gets, the shaper resistance line the Cernox thermometer's resistance will act (\figureref{r(t)}).

\begin{figure}[!htb]\centering
   \begin{minipage}{0.49\textwidth}
     \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{figures/thermometercx.JPG}
     \caption{Cernox Thermometer}\label{thermometer}
   \end{minipage}
   \begin {minipage}{0.49\textwidth}
     \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{figures/R(T).JPG}
     \caption{Temperature dependence of the thermometer}\label{r(t)}
   \end{minipage}
\end{figure}
 
 
However, going from \SI{4}{\kelvin} to \SI{300}{\milli\kelvin} is a big leap and there are problems that we have to overcome.
The most significant one is sealing in \ce{^{3}He} liquid environment.
Since the heat generated by the non-radiative relaxation is very small, the sample need to be in vacuum to avoid being carried away by massive \ce{^{3}He} liquid and a high heat conductive media to pass the temperature change to the thermometer.
Meanwhile, to keep the temperature around \SI{300}{\milli\kelvin}, we need something with low heat conductivity to connect the inside setup to outside.
In this case, we use thin sapphire crystal (cut by a diamond saw) as the bridge between sample and thermometer, thin magnin wire for keeping vacuum temperature low.
Sealing in \ce{^{3}He} liquid environment is hard due to the fact that it's molecules are so small that they'll just enter every tiny gap.
The way we used to seal is tapping the inner wall of the cap and outer wall of the base therefore compressing the flat surfaces of those two parts to seal.
But this is still not enough since the surfaces are polished mechanically only.
We dissolve soap in Glycerin and then scribble it on the surfaces to fill up any possible tiny gap.
Validation of the sealing can only be tested by whether the CR signal is resolved.

The whole vacuum can is immersed in \ce{^{3}He} liquid in a top-loaded \ce{^{3}He} refrigerator.
Microwave is sent through a self-made antenna which is connected to the coaxial cable in the probe (see \figureref{probe} and \figureref{thermal-schema}).

\section{Cyclotron resonance pretest}\label{Cyclotron}


 
We used a differential circuit to filter the background noise and amplitude modulation technique to quench the asymmetry left in the differential geometry.
The voltage signal difference from the two arms can be calculated in this formula: 

\begin{align} 
\frac{|\tilde{E}|}{|\tilde{V}|}=\frac{j \omega_{0}(M+L)\delta R}{R^{2}+2R j \omega_{0}L + \omega_{0}^{2} (M^{2}-L^{2})} \approx \frac{\delta R}{2R}
\end{align} 
 
That indicates that the output signal $V_{\mathrm{out}}$ is linearly proportional to the difference between the resistance of those two Cernox thermometers $\delta R$ which reflects the amount of heat generated by the sample with the illumination of microwave.
The differential signal was fed into the first lock-in amplifier the output of which then was fed into the second lock-in amp. 
The amplitude of the input microwave is modulated internally by the microwave generator according to the frequency of the second lock-in amp which should be much smaller than the rapid oscillating factor of the first lock-in amp. 
Therefore, after integrating twice, the final output should be a clean response of 2DEG CR signal.     
 
\figureref{r(b)} is the response of the thermometer resistance without microwave illumination when magnetic field is swept. There is some irregular response but the result is repeatable. Since the thermometers on the two arms have the same response, by using differential geometry, this influence can be cancelled.
This background indicates that the direction of the magnetic field has asymmetric influence on the two branches. 
\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[scale=0.25]{figures/R(B)UP.JPG}
  \caption{Background sweeping}
  \label{r(b)}
\end{figure}

When microwave is applied, obvious resonance peaks appear on each side (see \figureref{0dbm_40ghz}) and the larger the microwave power gets, the higher the resonance peaks shoot. In \figureref{thermopowerdep}, one can see that the signal can still be resolved even with power as low as -20dbm (\SI{0.01}{\milli \watt}). 
Compared to the setup without these two measuring techniques, sensitivity is at least thirty times higher in terms of input microwave power.

\section{Spin resonance on DPPH}\label{DPPH}

Electron spin resonance (ESR) or Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy is a technique for studying materials with unpaired electrons using the Zeeman splitting 
\begin{align}
E=m_{s} g \mu_{B} B_{0}
\end{align}
where g is the electron's Landé g-factor.
For the free electron, $g=2.0023$, $\mu_{B}$ is the Bohr magneton.
Therefore, resonance peak happens at 
\begin{align}
\Delta E=g \mu_{B} B_{0}
\end{align}

Conventional method of measuring ESR (commercialized) is transmission spectroscopy which measures the transmission or reflection coefficient.   
There are other ways such as magnetic torque detection, optically detected ESR, STM-ESR and resistively detected ESR which measures the longitudinal resistance of 2DEG. Our thermal detection method is another one by measuring the temperature change induced by the non-radiative relaxation of the photon absorption.

DPPH is a common abbreviation for an organic chemical compound 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl which has two major applications. One is for monitoring chemical reactions involving radicals while the other is determining the position and intensity of ESR signals. 
In our case, we use dpph to test if ESR signal can be resolved by our setup. 
Raw data is shown in \figureref{dpph_esr} and a clear resonance dip showed up around \SI{1.42}{\tesla} with a line width of 150 Gauss at the microwave frequency of \SI{40}{\giga \hertz}.
Therefore, the g-factor is
\begin{align}
g=\frac{\hbar \omega}{\mu_{B}B}=1.9934
\end{align}
while the theoretical value is the free electron $g=2.0023$.

By subtracting the background and fitting with a Lorentzian (\figureref{dpph_fitting}): 

\begin{align}
L(B)=\frac{A}{[1+ (\frac{\mu g \tau}{h})(B-B_{r})]^{2}}
\end{align}  
we have a decoherence time $\tau = \SI{7.78}{\nano\second}$ which is a reasonable value in our case.

\begin{figure}[!htb]\centering

     \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{figures/dpph_fitting.JPG}
     \caption{ESR fitting of DPPH}\label{dpph_fitting}
   \end{minipage}
\end{figure}
 

Here, we demonstrated that the nano-calorimeter we constructed has the ability to resolve both CR and ESR signals for those material which has a non-radiative relaxation process. 








\chapter{Microwave absorption spectroscopy of electrons in 2DEG}\label{Absorption}

This project is aim at investigating the number and velocity of charge modes for edge states on a 2DEG.
With its edge being pure one dimensional and dissipationless,
[from Jennifer Cano, Andrew C. Doherty, Chetan Nayak, and David J. Reilly Microwave absorption by a mesoscopic quantum Hall droplet Phys. Rev. B 88, 165305 (2013)]
it has tremendous potential applications.
We patterned high mobility \ce{AlGaAs/GaAs} wafer ($n_{e} \approx \SI{1e11}{cm^{-2}}$, $\mu \approx \SI{15 e6}{\cm^{2}/\volt \second}$) with circular discs with a diameter of several microns by lithography. 
For such a quantum droplet, the minimum energy of the excitations of the edge is $2\pi \hbar \nu /L$. 
The circumference of the droplet is $L=2\pi R$ and the velocity of the charge mode $\nu \approx \SI{1e4}{m/s}$.

To match the microwave energy $\hbar \omega_{M}$, we have 
\begin{align}
\nu = R \omega_{M}
\end{align}
Meanwhile, the velocity of electrons going on cyclotron motion under magnetic field is 
\begin{align}
\nu = 2 f_{c} l_{B}= \frac{2 \omega_{c}}{\pi} l_{B} 
\end{align}
where $\displaystyle \omega_{c}= \frac{eB}{m^{\ast}m_{0}}$ and $\displaystyle l_{B}=\sqrt{\frac{\hbar}{eB}}=\frac{257}{\sqrt{B}} \si{\angstrom}$.
Therefore, for electrons in \ce{AlGaAs/GaAs}, the resonant frequency is related to the radius of the disc in the following way:

\begin{align}
R_{e}= \frac{\omega_{x}}{\omega_{M}} \frac{l_{B}}{\pi} = \frac{eB}{m^{\ast}m_{0}} \frac{257 \si{\angstrom}}{\sqrt{B}} \frac{1}{2 \pi^{2} f_{M}} =3.4 \si{\micro \meter} \frac{\sqrt{B}}{\si{\giga \hertz}}
\end{align}

By sweeping magnetic field or microwave frequency, we should be able to see a resonant peak with a line width related to the distribution of the disc radius. 


\section{Setup construction and calibration}\label{Construction}

We used a co-plane meanderline waveguide 
[from C. Clauss, D. Bothner, D. Koelle, R. Kleiner, L. Bogani, M. Scheer, and M. Dressel Broadband electron spin resonance from 500 MHz to 40 GHz using superconducting coplanar waveguides Applied Physics Letters (2013), Bd. 102, H. Article 162601, S.]
to hold the patterned sample then placed the waveguide on the top of a broad band sample holder. Electrical connection is done by silver paste.  
The sample holder is connected to the coaxial cable in the transmission probe by a mini-SMP connector.
Again, this whole setup is immersed in \ce{^{3}He} liquid by our top-load \ce{^{3}He} cryostat.


\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[scale=0.25]{figures/configuration.JPG}
  \caption{Microwave absorption spectroscopy construction}
  \label{configuration}
\end{figure}
 
We used AM modulation at \SI{17}{\hertz} for measuring except this time, the output signal is the returning microwave intensity. It can be measured by our Schottky diode detector which works in a range of $\SI{10}{\mega \hertz}$ - $\SI{40}{\giga \hertz}$ and has a maximum input of 20dbm. 
The signal from the detector is a negative voltage which we then feed into our lock-in amp.

We calibrated the system by monitoring the reading of the lock-in amp while sweeping input microwave frequency and power intensity.
\figureref{spec} shows the relation between $V_{out}$ and $f_{in}$ with a constant power of $\SI{1}{\milli \watt}$. We can see that for small frequencies (below $\SI{12}{\giga \hertz}$), it is a linear dependence approximately and there are fluctuations after that.



\figureref{multifre} shows how the voltage acts when input power is increased at a sampling rate of $\SI{1}{\giga \hertz}$. It's reasonable that larger microwave intensity will result in higher voltage reading. And the lower the frequency is, the shaper the slope gets. 

\begin{figure}[!htb]\centering
   \begin{minipage}{0.49\textwidth}
     \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{figures/spec.JPG}
     \label{spec}
   \end{minipage}
   \begin {minipage}{0.49\textwidth}
     \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{figures/multifre.JPG}
     \label{multifre}
   \end{minipage}
   \caption{setup calibration}
\end{figure}


 
This means our setup works better at lower frequencies. 
Actually, if we do a polynomial fitting (\figureref{cali_fitting}) at $\SI{2}{\giga \hertz}$, the result is very satisfying. 
 

\begin{figure}[!htb]\centering
   \begin{minipage}{0.49\textwidth}
     \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{figures/cali_fitting.JPG}
     \caption{Polynomial fitting}\label{cali_fitting}
   \end{minipage}
   \begin {minipage}{0.49\textwidth}
     \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{figures/CRpowerdep.JPG}
     \caption{CR pretest}\label{crpowerdep}
   \end{minipage}
\end{figure}


Therefore, it is quite convincing that the negative voltage measured by the detector has a polynomial dependence with the input power intensity.
 
 


 
 
\section{Cyclotron resonance pretest}\label{Cyclotron}

CR is a good test for this setup at larger frequencies so that electrons can go at least one circle before any collision and the peaks are separated far enough to resolve. 
\figureref{crpowerdep} shows symmetric CR peaks appear when magnetic field is swept and the signal is higher with larger input power.  









\section{Improvement underway}\label{Improvement}

Though CR can be resolved clearly, we are unable to see authentic repeatable edge state absorption peaks
and there are sudden bursts of noise due to reflection and thermal fluctuation.
Possible reasons are noise level being too high, N-grease being too thick for electric field to probe edge state or even current equipment precision being not high enough to resolve the edge state absorption. 
We've come up with new ideas to improve the situation and new design is ready to be manufactured. 





\chapter{Summary}\label{summary}

In this report, we showed the work that was done since the summer in 2013. The main theme is using microwave to detect various resonance phenomenon including CR, ESR, GR, and edge state. We different developed tools for different purposes such as transport, thermal and absorption measurement setups. We successfully resolved CR on 2DEG, GR on 2DEG, ESR on DDPH and are working on detecting edge state resonance.
